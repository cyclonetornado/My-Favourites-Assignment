      Sleep is important to a number of brain functions, including how nerve
      cells (neurons) communicate with each other. In fact, your brain and body
      stay remarkably active while you sleep. Recent findings suggest that sleep
      plays a housekeeping role that removes toxins in your brain that build up
      while you are awake. It is a fundamental need of Humans, taking up
      approximately 1/3 of each day, and there is no quite such thing that I do
      for this long every day/24hrs. Click on the image to learn more.

      Duolingo is the world's best free app that teaches you some of the worlds
      most popular languages among language learners. It offers organized and
      progressive lessons that constantly draw on old material, that allows the
      learner to use previously learned material while learning new things. My
      chosen language to learn on Duolingo is French, which I also learn in
      school, and it provides good practice from time-to-time.

      Computer science is one of the things I recently started learning in
      school, and the things you can do with it are pretty cool and useful,
      which is why it is used all around us today. Learning computer science is
      fun and engaging and it allows me to be creative, and it also provides
      many career oppurtunities in the future. One of my favorite YouTubers who
      teaches computer science is
